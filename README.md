# 🌐 LanguageTranslator-Tool

A high-performance, professional-grade language translation application built during my internship at **CodeAlpha**. This tool demonstrates advanced React.js concepts, seamless API integration, and a premium user experience.

## 🚀 Overview
This project is not just a simple translator; it’s a fully functional utility that bridges the gap between complex backend APIs and a modern, glassmorphic frontend. It handles real-time data fetching, state management, and accessibility through voice output.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Real-time Translation:** Powered by the stable MyMemory API for high-speed cross-language support.
* **Voice Synthesis Module:** Integrated browser-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) to listen to translations instantly.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Built with **Tailwind CSS v4**, featuring a premium dark-themed interface, spotlight effects, and glassmorphism.
* **Interactive Elements:** Includes a real-time character counter, language swapping, and one-click clipboard copying.
* **Optimized Performance:** Developed using **Vite** for ultra-fast HMR and build times.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Frontend:** React.js (Hooks, Functional Components)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React Icons
* **API Handling:** Axios (Custom GET requests with language-pair parameters)
* **UI Components:** Customized Shadcn/UI for professional-grade inputs and buttons.
* **Notifications:** Sonner for sleek, non-intrusive user feedback.
